William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616)[a]
was an English playwright, poet, and actor, widely regarded as
the greatest writer in the English language and the world's
greatest dramatist.
[2][3][4] He is often called England's national
poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").
[5][b] His
extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39
plays,
[c] 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other
verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been
translated into every major living language and are performed
more often than those of any other playwright.
[7] They also
continue to be studied and reinterpreted.
Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,
Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway,
with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet
and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a
successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of
a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later
known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears
to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few
records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated
considerable speculation about such matters as his physical
appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the
works attributed to him were written by others.
[8][9][10]
Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589
and 1613.[11][12][d] His early plays were primarily comedies and
histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in
these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among
them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and
Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the
English language.
[2][3][4]
In the last phase of his life, he wrote
tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with
other playwrights.
Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of
varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623,
two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges
and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as
the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's
dramatic works that included all but two of his plays.
[13] The
volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which
Jonson presciently hailed Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as
"not of an age, but for all time".

[e]
school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was
standardised by royal decree,
[24][25] and the school would have provided
an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.
[26]
At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The
consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on
27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted
bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.
[27] The
ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester
chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the
usual three times,
[28][29] and six months after the marriage Anne gave
birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.[30] Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed
almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.[31] Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of
11 and was buried 11 August 1596.[32]
After the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until
he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The
exception is the appearance of his name in the "complaints bill" of a
law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated
Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589.[33] Scholars refer to the
years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's "lost years".
[34]
Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many
apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer,
recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for
London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local
squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his
revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him.
[35][36]
Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical
career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London.[37] John
Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country
schoolmaster.
[38] Some 20th-century scholars suggested that
Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by
Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named
a certain "William Shakeshafte" in his will.
[39][40] Little evidence
substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death,
and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.
[41][42]
It is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of
performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.[43] By then, he was
sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of
Wit:
... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger's heart wrapped in a
Player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and
being an absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.
[44]
London and theatrical career
"All the world's a stage,
and all the men and women merely players:
they have their exits and their entrances;
and one man in his time plays many parts ..."
—As You Like It, Act II, Scene 7, 139–142[53]
Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words,
[44][45] but most agree that Greene was accusing
Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher
Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called "University Wits").
[46] The italicised phrase
parodying the line "Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide" from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, along
with the pun "Shake-scene", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, Johannes
Factotum ("Jack of all trades") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more
common "universal genius".
[44][47]
Greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that
his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks.
[48][49][50] After
1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a
group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London.[51] After
the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and
changed its name to the King's Men.
[52]
In 1599, a partnership of members of the company built
their own theatre on the south bank of the River
Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the
partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre.
Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and
investments indicate that his association with the
company made him a wealthy man,[54] and in 1597, he
bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place,
and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in
Stratford.[55]
Some of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had
become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.
[56][57][58] Shakespeare continued to act in his
own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on
the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603).
[59] The absence of his name
from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was
nearing its end.[48] The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of "the Principal Actors in all
these Plays", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although one cannot know for certain which roles
he played.[60]
In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that "good Will" played "kingly" roles.
[61]
In 1709,
Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father.
[36] Later traditions
maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in Henry V,
[62][63]
though scholars doubt
the sources of that information.[64]
Throughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before
he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St. Helen's,
Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames.
[65][66] He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same
year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.
[65][67] By 1604, he had moved north of the river again,
to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French
Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of women's wigs and other headgear.
[68][69]
Later years and death
Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to
Stratford "some years before his death".
[70][71] He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an
answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the
Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men "placed men players" there, "which were
Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.".
[72] However, it is perhaps relevant
that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609.[73][74] The
London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks
of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and
February 1610),
[75] which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement
from all work was uncommon at that time.
[76] Shakespeare continued to visit
London during the years 1611–1614.[70]
In 1612, he was called as a witness
in Bellott v Mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of
Mountjoy's daughter, Mary.
[77][78]
In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in
the former Blackfriars priory;[79] and from November 1614, he was in
London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall.
[80] After 1610,
Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.[81]
His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher,
[82] who
succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men.[83]
Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52.[f] He died within a
month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself
as being in "perfect health". No extant contemporary source explains how or
why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in
his notebook: "Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting
and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there
contracted",
[84][85] not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew
Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his
relatively sudden death: "We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so
soon / From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room."[86][g]
He was survived by his wife and two
daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607,[87]
and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before
Shakespeare's death.[88] Shakespeare signed his last will and
testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law,
Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by
Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was
ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have
caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare
family.
[88]
Shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder
daughter Susanna[89] under stipulations that she pass it down intact to
"the first son of her body".
[90] The Quineys had three children, all of
whom died without marrying.[91][92] The Halls had one child,
Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line.
[93][94]
Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate
automatically.
[h] He did make a point, however, of leaving her "my second best bed", a bequest that has led to
much speculation.[96][97][98] Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that
the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.
[99]
Shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death.[100][101] The
epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was
carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:[102]
Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare,
To digg the dvst encloased heare.
Bleste be y man y spares thes stones,
And cvrst be he y moves my bones.
[103][i]
(Modern spelling: Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, / To dig the
dust enclosed here. / Blessed be the man that spares these stones, /
And cursed be he that moves my bones.)
Some time before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his
memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of
writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil.
[104]
In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the
Droeshout engraving was published.[105]
Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials
around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets' Corner in Westminster
Abbey.
[106][107]
Procession of Characters from Shakespeare's Plays by an unknown 19th-century
artist
Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that
Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career.
[108]
The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI, written in the early
1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely,
however,
[109][110] and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming
of the Shrew, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period.[111][109]
His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England,
Scotland, and Ireland,
[112] dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted
as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty.
[113] The early plays were influenced by the works of
other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval
drama, and by the plays of Seneca.
[114][115][116] The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models,
but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same
name and may have derived from a folk story.
[117][118] Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two
friends appear to approve of rape,
[119][120][121]
the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent
spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.
[122]
Shakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic
sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.
[123] A
Midsummer Night's Dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.
[124]
Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic Merchant of Venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful
Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern

audiences.
[125][126] The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About
Nothing,
[127]
the charming rural setting of As You Like It, and the
lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare's
sequence of great comedies.
[128] After the lyrical Richard II, written
almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into
the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V.
His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly
between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the
narrative variety of his mature work.[129][130][131] This period begins
and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, the famous romantic
tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;[132][133]
and Julius Caesar—based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of
Plutarch's Parallel Lives—which introduced a new kind of
drama.
[134][135] According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius Caesar, "the various strands of
politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing,
began to infuse each other".
[136]
In the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called "problem
plays" Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All's Well That
Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies.
[137][138] Many
critics believe that Shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak
of his art. The titular hero of one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies,
Hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other
Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which
begins "To be or not to be; that is the question".
[139] Unlike the
introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the
tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty
errors of judgement.
[140] The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often
hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy
the hero and those he loves.
[141]
In Othello, the villain Iago stokes
Othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent
wife who loves him.
[142][143]
In King Lear, the old king commits the
tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of
Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, "the
play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty".
[144][145][146]
In Macbeth,
the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies,
[147] uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and
his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in
turn.[148]
In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies,
Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus, contain some of Shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his
most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot.
[149][150][151]
In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays:
Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less
bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with
reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.
[152] Some commentators have seen this change
in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the
theatrical fashion of the day.
[153][154][155] Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry
VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.
[156]Performances
The reconstructed Globe Theatre on
the south bank of the River Thames
in London
It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of
Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.
[157] After the plagues of
1592–93, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in
Shoreditch, north of the Thames.
[158] Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV, Leonard
Digges recording, "Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room".
[159] When
the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the
timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the
Thames at Southwark.
[160][161] The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with Julius Caesar one of the first plays
staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including Hamlet, Othello,
and King Lear.
[160][162][163]
After the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in
1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James.
Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men
performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November
1604, and 31 October 1605, including two performances of The
Merchant of Venice.
[63] After 1608, they performed at the indoor
Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the
summer.
[164] The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion
for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more
elaborate stage devices. In Cymbeline, for example, Jupiter descends
"in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a
thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees."[165][166]
The actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous Richard
Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges.
Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including Richard
III, Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear.
[167] The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in
Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing, among other characters.
[168][169] He was
replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in
King Lear.
[170]
In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII "was set forth with many extraordinary
circumstances of pomp and ceremony".
[171] On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe
and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare
precision.[171]
In 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the
First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first
time.
[172] Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of
paper folded twice to make four leaves.
[173] No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions,
which the First Folio describes as "stol'n and surreptitious copies".
[174]
 Nor did Shakespeare plan or expect his
works to survive in any form at all; those works likely would have faded into oblivion but for his friends'
spontaneous idea, after his death, to create and publish the First Folio.[175]
Alfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as "bad quartos" because of their adapted, paraphrased or
garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.
[173][174][176] Where several
versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing
errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers.
[177][178]
In some cases,
for example, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the
quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the

confusion.[179]
